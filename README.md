# React Green Bay

This is the repo I used to present at the [Sept 17th, 2019 event](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Green-Bay/events/264528391/).

The demo goes through different ways of managing state in React. The following branches display the different styles over the years:

- `og`
- `redux`
- `hooks`
- `mgmt` (tool to manage your state using hooks + context)
- `mgmt-multiple-reducers` (example of `mgmt` with multiple reducers)
- `mgmt-middleware` (example of `mgmt` with an API layer)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
